## 📖 Project Overview
This project details the design and implementation of an autonomous mobile robot built for the **Embedded Systems** course at **Princess Sumaya University for Technology**. 

The robot is designed to navigate a complex multi-zone track comprising:
1.  **Line Following Zone:** High-speed tracking.
2.  **Tunnel Zone:** Automatic buzzer activation via LDR.
3.  **Obstacle Zone:** Logic to detect and navigate around physical barriers.
4.  **Parking Zone:** Precision maneuvering and flag raising.

**Key Constraint:** The firmware was written entirely from scratch **without using built-in libraries** (no `Delay_ms`, no Servo library, no Ultrasonic library). Custom drivers were written for Timer Interrupts, PWM, and ADC.

## 💻 Software Implementation

### The "No-Library" Challenge
To demonstrate low-level understanding, standard libraries were replaced with custom drivers:

1.  **Ultrasonic Driver (Timer1):**
    * Instead of `PulseIn()`, we configured **Timer1** with a 1:2 prescaler.
    * The code gates the timer while the Echo pin is HIGH.
    * **Formula:** `Distance (cm) = Timer_Ticks / 58` (Derived for 8MHz Clock).

2.  **Software PWM (Timer0):**
    * **Timer0** generates an interrupt every 1 ms.
    * A global PWM counter (0-99) increments on every interrupt.
    * Motor pins are toggled based on a comparison between the counter and the target speeds `speed_req_left` and `speed_req_right`, allowing for smooth motion.

### Finite State Machine
The main loop executes a non-blocking switch-case state machine:

### **Key Features**
1.  **Custom Ultrasonic Driver:** Uses **Timer1** to measure Echo pulse width with 1µs precision.
2.  **Software PWM:** Uses **Timer0 Interrupts** to generate variable duty cycles for motor speed control on standard digital pins.
3.  **Adaptive Logic:** Distinguishes between a physical wall (Obstacle) and a 30° incline (Bump) by analyzing the change in sensor data.
